# 🧠 Immigration Predictor

An AI-powered forecasting platform designed to help governments, NGOs, and international organizations **predict future migration flows** driven by war, climate change, economic instability, and policy changes.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

Build a real-time intelligent dashboard that enables:

- 📈 **Migration flow forecasting** (3–12 months ahead)
- 🌍 **Visualization of global risk factors** (climate, conflict, economy)
- 🧪 **Simulation of “what-if” scenarios**
- 🛰️ **Integration of multi-source data** (UNHCR, ACLED, NASA, etc.)

---

## 🌐 Real-World Use Cases

- 🏛️ Government migration policy and resource planning  
- 🚑 Humanitarian logistics: housing, healthcare, border control  
- ⚠️ Early warning systems for refugee/displacement crises  
- 📊 Academic and policy research
