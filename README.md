# 🧠 Immigration Predictor

An AI-powered forecasting platform that helps governments and humanitarian organizations **predict future migration flows** due to war, climate change, economic instability, and policy shifts.

## 🚀 Project Goal

To build a real-time, intelligent dashboard that allows:

- 📈 **Forecasting migration flows** (3–12 months ahead)
- 🌍 **Visualizing global risk factors** (climate, conflict, economy)
- 🧪 **Simulating "what-if" scenarios**
- 🛰️ **Integrating multi-source data (UNHCR, ACLED, NASA, etc.)**

## 🌐 Real-World Use Cases

- Government migration planning
- Humanitarian logistics (housing, healthcare, border control)
- Early-warning systems for refugee crises
- Academic and policy research
